*Weekly Task number 2:*

For the Statements topic in week 2, I had to write a program that calculates somebody's Body Mass Index (BMI). 
* The inputs are the person's height in centimetres and weight in kilograms.
* The output is their weight divided by their height in metres squared.

I defined my inputs with the prefix of 'int' to ensure the number is a whole number.
 
I referenced the below link for a BMI formula using centimetres in the calculation.  
BMI formula link: https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/childrens_bmi/childrens_bmi_formula.html  
The formula for BMI is weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.  
If height has been measured in centimeters, divide by 100 to convert this to meters

To round the result to 2 decimal places I referenced w3schools  
https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_round.asp

*Weekly Task number 3:*

For the Variables topic in week 3, I had to write a program that asks a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order.

String input is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
